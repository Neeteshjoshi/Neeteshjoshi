âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the idea of a "computer bug" comes from an actual insect? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. She removed the moth and taped it into the computer's logbook, noting it as the "first actual case of bug being found." This incident led to the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches.
